Analysis of the complete lyrics of Eminem and Tupac (As of Jan 2020)
I have applied basic NLP approaches to the complete lyrics of the two rappers Eminem and Tupac. I started by preprocessing the corpus and preparing it to calculate basic statistics on the documents. I then extracted the most frequent words and collocations and computed the text readability for each document. I also identified the most-appeared Named Entities and calculated the tf-idf scores to extract the most relevant terms for each document. Finally, I used the Sentiment Analysis approach to produce a label to summarize the sentiment of the text.
